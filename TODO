libxzfile To-Do List
====================

Portability:
  - Set errno = ENOMEM if malloc() fails?

Bugs:
  - Should it remember errnum in all situations? CHECK ALL errnum USES!
  - Maximum buffer size should be at most XZF_OFF_MAX. How to enforce it?
    Silently use smaller or give an error?

See:
  - Glibc Notes in freopen(3)

Features:
  - Thread cancellation support
  - Function to create a temp file
  - perror-like with printf format
  - Store extra data in streams. Maybe implement fileno() this way?
  - Should the offset be cached for fast seeking and fast retrieval of
    the current offset, or should it always lead to backend seek call?
